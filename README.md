# Shop App

This is a simple shopping application where users can log in and place an order of items they want from the shop. Users can also mark any item they like as a favorite and filter only their favorite items. 

This application uses Firebase as the backend and the process of adding/removing products is done via API calls. 
It also has the functionality of auto-logging in users who are already authenticated.
